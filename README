This plugin provides the |:Templator| command that can be used to easily 
create multi-file projects.

In many programming languges/environments, you usually work with a set of files 
that belong together. E.g. if you create a c file, you usually also want to 
create a h header file. If you create a viewer file, you usually also want to 
create corresponding model and controller files. If you want to create a 
library file, you usually also want to create some test file etc. This is were 
templator comes in.

The templator plugin allows the creation of filesets based on multi-file 
templates. Possible use cases:

    - Create multi-file projects
    - Create multiple-files within a project, e.g.
        - a source file and the corresponding header file
        - a source file and the corresponding test file
        - files for a model, a view, and a controller

Templates can be written in any code template/skeleton/snippets style. At the 
time of writing, templates can be written in:

    - template vim (see |templator-tvim|) ("tvim" extension)
    - tskeleton (vimscript #1160) ("tskel" extension)

It shoudln't be too difficult to add support for additional template 
engines.


Tutorial~

The vimplugin template, which is provided with the plugin, consist of the following files: >

    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.tvim/README_${1}.TXT
    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.tvim/docs/${1}.txt
    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.tvim/plugin/${1}.vim
    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.tvim/autoload/${1}.vim

and an optional vim script (see |templator-scripts|) in:
    
    ~/.vim/templator/vimplugin.vim

The command call >

    :Templator ~/src/foo/bar/vimplugin myplugin

will result in the creation of the following files: >

    ~/src/foo/bar/README_myplugin.TXT
    ~/src/foo/bar/docs/myplugin.txt
    ~/src/foo/bar/plugin/myplugin.vim
    ~/src/foo/bar/autoload/myplugin.vim

Any placeholders within the files are expanded.
